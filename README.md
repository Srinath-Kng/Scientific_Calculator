A basic scientific calculator created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript can perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division as well as advanced mathematical functions such as trigonometry and logarithmic operations.

The calculator interface is created using HTML and styled using CSS to give it a user-friendly look and feel. JavaScript is used to provide the calculator's functionality, with event listeners that detect button clicks and input values, and functions that perform the desired mathematical operations.

The calculator usually contains buttons for numbers 0-9, decimal point, and various mathematical operations, as well as buttons for advanced functions like sine, cosine, tangent, natural logarithm, and exponential. The calculator also has a display screen that shows the current calculation and the result.

The Website is only optimized for Desktop and not for Mobile View.

Overall, a basic scientific calculator created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript is a useful tool for performing mathematical calculations quickly and easily.
